## What is the Eisenhower Method

The "Eisenhower Method" stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."Note that Eisenhower does not claim this insight for his own, but attributes it to an (unnamed) "former college president."

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix. Tasks are then handled as follows:

- **Important/Urgent** quadrant are done immediately and personally e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
- **Important/Not Urgent** quadrant get an end date and are done personally e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
- **Unimportant/Urgent** quadrant are delegated e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.
- **Unimportant/Not Urgent** quadrant are dropped e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.

   - Add your desired time wasters and win them with XP points
   - You will collect coins to play SlotMachine game to win your desired tasks. (Eg: Watch 1 episoe of your favorite series)
